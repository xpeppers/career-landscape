                      We believe that people knowledge is best represented as a landscape, with hills and valley,
                      peaks and depression, more than a ledger like is usualy represented.
                      The idea of a landscape is more linked to a non linear path ( and in some way random path )
                      of knowledge development, instead of a linear predefined path, suitable for everyone.
